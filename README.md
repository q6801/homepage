## Purpose
```
This homepage is a web based on the information about korean girl singer. it will never pursue the profits using ad or something else. 
Do you know how these singers became famous? 
It was not only their cuteness and beauty but also their efforts struggling to be top.
And I want to be strong like them. In conclusion, I want to inform these singers to lots of people

```
this is main homepage. when I draw this homepage at first time, I decided to make main page looks very simple

```

![gallery0](/src/assets/img/screenShot/gallery0.PNG)
```
I want to arrange lots of pictures. but arrange in columm side looks dirty to me. so I made 4 straight lines 
and set photos in their own seats. 
when the first time I made this gallery it has no response. it makes my site less funny and interested. 
so I added some effects when user puts their mouse on the photo it changes its opacity.

```
![profile0](/src/assets/img/screenShot/profile0.PNG)
```
I replace buttons to thumbnails. and this idea changes this site softer and more adorable.
Also made this as responsive. thumbnails change their location when width became small.

```
![calendar0](/src/assets/img/screenShot/calendar0.JPG)
```
and this is our last page. It is just calendar but I don't use other api. I made my own calendar system.
still I have lots of modifications to add other many systems. It can't add other schedule cause I didn't make yet. 

```
